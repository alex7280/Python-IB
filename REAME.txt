1. The program consist of 5 different programs: Stock Price TGP,Stock Price TGP PRa,Stock Price TGP PRb,YTC TGP,CompanyAccountingInfo TGP, PlaceSellOrder
2. I am using Pycharm community edition and the location that I save excel files to is D:\TWS API\source\pythonclient\ibapi, this can be changed inside py
3. Stock Price TGP and CompanyAccountingInfo TGP need to be run before YTC TGP
4. I can't acquire some of the data so I used parameter to replace them: they are preferred stock dividends, common and preferred stock call price,
share outstanding numbers.
5.openpyxl need to be installed for this program to run
6.Currently, I can't figure out a way that can read all the stock tickers from a file and find their dividend yield, because tws api
doesn't provide enough IB dividend for preferred shares, which causes exception when I tried to get these info and breaks the loop. Sorry about this
7. The general structure is Stock Price TGP,Stock Price TGP PRa,Stock Price TGP PRb,YTC TGP,CompanyAccountingInfo TGP set up all the information that Place and Sell Order Need.
 Place and Sell Order is the main component of this.
